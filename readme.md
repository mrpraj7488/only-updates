I can see you've shared the backend API proxy server configuration for VidGro. This looks like a well-structured Node.js Express server that acts as a secure proxy between your mobile app and Supabase, keeping all sensitive API keys server-side.

The current project appears to be the React admin panel frontend. Would you like me to:

Update the admin panel to connect to this backend API proxy instead of directly to Supabase
Add the backend server files to this project structure
Configure the environment variables to work with your proxy server
Set up the development workflow to run both frontend and backend together
Or is there something specific you'd like me to help you with regarding this setup?

The backend server you've shared has excellent security features including API key authentication, rate limiting, CORS protection, and comprehensive error handling. It properly proxies all the VidGro operations like user management, video operations, and transaction handling while keeping sensitive tokens secure.
